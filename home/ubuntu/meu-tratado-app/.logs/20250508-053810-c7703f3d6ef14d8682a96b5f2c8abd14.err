Failed to compile.

./lib/openai.ts
Module not found: Can't resolve 'openai'
Did you mean './openai'?
Requests that should resolve in the current directory need to start with './'.
Requests that start with a name are treated as module requests and resolve within module directories (node_modules, /usr/local/nvm/versions/node/v22.14.0/lib/node_modules).
If changing the source code is not an option there is also a resolve options called 'preferRelative' which tries to resolve these kind of requests in the current directory too.
